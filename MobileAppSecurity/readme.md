# Black Box Penetration Testing

What is Black Box Testing?
Black box testing is the process of simulating a skilled attack, using the techniques and tools aimed to detect security vulnerabilities and exploit them.

Our experts will simulate a real attack on the application. The testing process covers a wide range of application-level vulnerabilities as defined by OWASP and WASC, targeting potentially harmful vulnerabilities in your application.

The testing process will reveal the vulnerabilities, potential exploitation damage and severity.

The detailed report you receive will include recommendations that will assist you in securing your systems and protecting your companies’ assets and integrity.

All application level vulnerabilities will be covered in the context of a Black Box test. Specifically, the testing methodologies used are OWASP and WASC, which provides full coverage over application level vulnerabilities. Some of the covered attacks:

# Vulnerabilities Covered
SQL Injection – taking control over the database
Hidden Backdoors – used by attackers to easily infiltrate the system over and over
Cross-site Scripting – injecting malicious code to innocent user browsers
Cross-site Request Forgery – impersonating an innocent user and performing actions in his name
Bypassing Authentication – taking over user and administrator accounts
Authorization Breaches – performing unauthorized actions and accessing unauthorized information
Bypassing Crypto – viewing confidential and private information by unauthorized people
Open Redirects – an open door to phishing attacks and scams
Command Injection – injecting commands to a remote server and taking over
Forceful Browsing – bypassing restrictions and performing unauthorized actions
Bypassing Business-Logic Restrictions – performing application-specific actions that are not authorized by the company’s regulations
LFI/RFI – injecting malicious code to a vulnerable application
Denial of Service – making the application unavailable to remote users


# Gray Box Penetration Testing

## Vulnerabilities Covered
Gray Box test provides a full, comprehensive test which results in a hybrid between finding vulnerabilities which are relevant for both White Box test and a Black Box test. The testing methodologies are OWASP and WASC methodologies which cover wide-range of application security vulnerabilities. Some of the covered vulnerabilities:

* SQL Injection – taking control over the database
* Hidden Backdoors – used by attackers to easily infiltrate the system over and over
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – injecting malicious code into innocent user’s browsers
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) – impersonating an innocent user and performing actions in his name
* Bypassing Authentication – taking over users and administrators accounts
* Authorization Breaches – performing unauthorized actions and accessing unauthorized information
* Bypassing Crypto – viewing of confidential and private info by unauthorized people
* Open Redirects – an open door to phishing attacks and scams
* Command Injection – injecting commands to a remote server and taking over
* Forceful Browsing – bypassing restrictions and perfoming unauthorized actions
* Bypassing Business-Logic Restrictions – performing application-specific actions that are not authorized by the company’s regulations
* LFI/RFI – injecting malicious code to a vulnerable application
* Denial of Service – making the application unavailable to remote users

Examples of open-source security testing tools for mobile apps include:

* **Santoku:**  A virtual machine that contains a number of open source tools specific to mobile application security testing, forensics and data recovery, and malware analysis.
* **Mobile Security Framework (MobSF):** Automated penetration testing framework for Android and iOS apps including static and dynamic analysis and web API testing capabilities.
* **Mitmproxy:** Allows a user to intercept and modify requests and responses exchanged between an app and backend services in order to inspect any data transferred.
* **Drozer:** Identifies security vulnerabilities in Android apps and devices and supports the use and sharing of public exploits.
* **Frida:** An analyst can use Frida to inject JavaScript snippets into native Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android apps. Created and maintained by NowSecure researcher Ole André V. Ravnås and sponsored by NowSecure.
* **Radare:** A reverse-engineering framework used to analyze and inspect iOS and Android binaries. Created and maintained by NowSecure researcher Sergi Álvarez and sponsored by NowSecure.

# Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)
* [Mobile Security Framework - MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an intelligent, all-in-one open source mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) automated pen-testing framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. It can be used for effective and fast security analysis of Android, iOS and Windows mobile Applications and supports both binaries (APK, IPA & APPX ) and zipped source code. MobSF can also perform Web API Security testing with it's API Fuzzer that can do Information Gathering, analyze Security Headers, identify Mobile API specific vulnerabilities like XXE, SSRF, Path Traversal, IDOR, and other logical issues related to Session and API Rate Limiting.
